# Big-Data-Review-Prediction
I recently worked on an exciting Big Data project in collaboration with Arajem Aboudi as part of my Masterâ€™s in Big Data Analytics for Business. This project challenged us to apply advanced data processing and machine learning techniques using PySpark to tackle a real-world problem. 
We worked with BLU, a French e-commerce company, to analyze customer reviews and build a predictive model to determine whether an order review would be positive (4-5) or negative (1-3). This required handling large-scale transactional data and applying Big Data methodologies to derive actionable business insights.

ðŸ“Š Key Features & Techniques Used:

âœ… Data Processing with PySpark â†’ Handled 50k+ orders, applied Spark SQL/PySpark for efficient data transformations and feature engineering.
âœ… Feature Engineering â†’ Created customer behavior features, delivery efficiency metrics, and product-level attributes to enhance prediction accuracy.
âœ… Machine Learning Models â†’ Evaluated and optimized with Hyperparameters Selection on multiple models:
Gradient Boosting | Random Forest | Support Vector Machine (SVM) | Linear Regression
âœ… Performance Optimization â†’ Applied data partitioning, caching and parallel processing for scalability.
âœ… Key Business Insights â†’ Identified major factors influencing customer reviews, such as delivery delays and product categories, helping BLU improve retention strategies.


ðŸŽ¤ Final Evaluation & Presentation:
Beyond the technical implementation, we presented our work to both technical and non-technical audiences. This required translating complex machine learning concepts into clear, actionable insights for senior management and business teams.


ðŸŒŸ What I Gained from this Project:
âœ” Hands-on experience in PySpark for Big Data processing & ML modeling.
âœ” Deeper understanding of feature engineering & model evaluation in large datasets.
âœ” Improved ability to communicate data-driven insights to different stakeholders.
âœ” Experience in working as a team on an end-to-end data science project.
