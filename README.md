# Big-Data-Review-Prediction
I recently worked on an exciting Big Data project in collaboration with Arajem Aboudi as part of my Masterâ€™s in Big Data Analytics for Business. This project challenged us to apply advanced data processing and machine learning techniques using PySpark to tackle a real-world problem. 
We worked with BLU, a French e-commerce company, to analyze customer reviews and build a predictive model to determine whether an order review would be positive (4-5) or negative (1-3). This required handling large-scale transactional data and applying Big Data methodologies to derive actionable business insights.
